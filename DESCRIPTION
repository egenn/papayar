Description: Users pass images and objects of class nifti from the oro.nifti 
  package to a Papaya, an interactive lightweight Javascript viewer. 
  Although many packages can view individual slices or projections of 
  image and matrix data, this package allows for quick and easy 
  interactive browsing of images.  The viewer is based off of the 
  Mango software, which is a lightweight medical image viewer.
